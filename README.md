# My styles for Stylus (an extension for custom browser styles)

- Install Stylus here: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus

## Available styles

### Facebook Gaming

- https://github.com/joecritch/stylus-styles/blob/master/facebook-gaming.css
- Currently only a Facebook Gaming one, as I wanted to make it feel more 'chat' like on the comment section (ala Twitch, etc.) They're very subtle tweaks.
- Go to `Create New Style` in Stylus and paste in the CSS.
- When editing the style, go to "Applies to: URLs starting with" at the bottom and add `https://www.facebook.com/yourfavestreamerhere`

## Disclaimer

- If something breaks, just disable the style within Stylus
