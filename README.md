# My styles for Stylus (an extension for custom browser styles)

- Install Stylus here: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus

## Available styles

- Currently only a Facebook Gaming one, as I wanted to make it feel more 'chat' like on the comment section (ala Twitch, etc.) They're very subtle tweaks.

## Disclaimer

- If something breaks, just disable the stylus style
